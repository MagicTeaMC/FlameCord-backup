<a href="https://builtbybit.com/resources/13492/" alt="FlameCord">FlameCord</a> is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord" alt="BungeeCord">BungeeCord</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PaperMC/Waterfall" alt="Waterfall">Waterfall</a> that protects your <a href="https://minecraft.net" alt="Minecraft">Minecraft</a> or <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/" alt="Spigot">Spigot</a> server from bot attacks and exploits with its advanced set of antibot filtering features. FlameCord also fixes bugs, improves performance and adds new functionalities to your server. FlameCord is the ultimate solution for a secure and fast Minecraft network.üî•

## ‚≠ê Features

FlameCord being a fork of Waterfall, has all its features, and some of its own, such as:

* **Exploit Fixes**: FlameCord specializes in providing better server security by fixing major exploits, performance flaws and bugs that Bungeecord already has, and that have not yet been fixed in Waterfall.
  
* **Antibot Features**: FlameCord brings swift bot protection for your Minecraft server to avoid extra CPU usage and crashes in your machines.

* **Performance Improvements**: FlameCord tries to improve performance by removing unused features and disabling exception logs.

## üíª Why fork Waterfall?

FlameCord was forked out of a desire for greater protection to be afforded to a Bungeecord-based proxy, which Waterfall currently cannot offer.

FlameCord will track upstream Waterfall and merge changes as needed.

## üå± Get Started

Just drag an drop FlameCord.jar into your server folder and run it.

You can customize many FlameCord features in the flamecord.yml file.
